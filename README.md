# spaole

SPAOLE is the abbreviation of following:

s -> source code
p -> Preprocessor
a -> assembly 
o -> object code
l -> linker
e -> executable

This is the genreal flow of compiling a C program.
Thus, SPAOLE is a simple self-compiling compiler based on C programming language.

This includes:

+ To write a self-compiling compiler.

+ To write code for atleast one hardware (mainly x86_64).

+ Follow certain priciples and algorithms which I will be adding soon.


I have been following the following repo and playing with the implementation to try some modifications.
